## 📌 Overview  
This project was developed **as part of the course "Human-Machine Interaction"** at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, NKUA.  
Our goal was to **evaluate, redesign, wireframe, and implement** an improved version of the official website [ntantades.gov.gr](https://ntantades.gov.gr), applying the knowledge acquired during the course.  

## 🛠 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Evaluation  
- Conducted a **heuristic evaluation** using **Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics**

- Created **user personas** and **task flow diagrams** to model user needs  

### 2️⃣ Redesign  
- Developed a **complete UI/UX redesign** based on evaluation findings  
- Created **wireframes** and **user journey scenarios** in **Figma**  
- Focused on improving usability, accessibility, and visual consistency  

### 3️⃣ Implementation  
- Built the improved website using **HTML, CSS, and React**  
- Ensured a **responsive** and **user-friendly** final product  

## 📷 Deliverables
